# About me

I graduated from Hanyang University, Department of Mathematics and am pursuing master degree in applied mathemathics at same university. From July 2018, I'm member of Cryptology & Algorithm Lab and am advised by Professor [Jae Hong Seo](https://sites.google.com/site/jhsbhs/). My main research interests are in cryptography especially zero-knowledge proof. Besides cryptography, I'm interested in artificial intelligence using deep learning such as face recognition and speaker recognition.
